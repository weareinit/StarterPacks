Well you've come to the right place. Buildings games (Or any kind of Human Driven Simulation) is becoming an important part of the tech landscape with technologies such as VR/AR and Gamification coming into the scene. Simulations can be incredibly complex pieces of software, but don't worry!! In this guide I'll do my best to provide ShellHacks/Online resources that will be useful to either begin learning or perfecting the art of making games. 

### Focused Area of Interest
This Starter Pack is aimed at the Hacker with an interest in building a hack around Human Interaction, Game Engines, Game Oriented Design, and AR/VR.

### General Development Tools
Just like someone about to start on their Pokemon Journey, you will have to choose between a couple of Game Engines. They all have their pros and cons, but any of them will be good to hack on. I do however highly recommend Unity since there will be a Unity Workshop at ShellHacks and a couple of organizers/volunteeers have experience in Unity if you ever need help. 

- [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) : Unity is one of the, if not the most, popular game engines out there. Unity provides plenty of resources for bigginers and it's intuitive GUI interface makes it a perfect fit for a quick hack. You will be using C# to write your scripts, more resources on that on Online resouces. (Supports VR and AR). TIP: If you are having a problem in Unity, look for answers online. There is a big chance someone solved it and posted the solution on the forums. 

- [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4) : Unreal Engine 4 is a high end game engine that powers some of the best triple A titles out there. Unreal is consider by many as the Game Engine with best performance and graphics, which at the same token bring a hightened level of dificulty. You will be using C++ to write you code, more resources on that on Online Resources. 

- [Amazon Lumberyard](https://aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/): Amazon Lumberyard is a moded version of the CryEngine Game Engine. The cool thing about this game engine is it's direct support to Amazon Web services such as AWS (Which if you did not know, Amazon is giving away AWS credits for free at ShellHacks). Because the engine is in Beta and lack of online resources, expect a hightened dificulty. You will be using C++ to write you code, more resources on that on Online Resources. 

### Companies of Interest
The following companies are present at ShellHacks and have involvement in Game Development.
- Amazon = creators of Lumberyard Game Engine. AWS is also heavily used in Game Development, even in Unity!! 
- Microsoft = upcoming Mixed Reality Headsets, Windows 10 Gaming, Xbox, VR,  and Hololens
- Facebook = They own Oculus as well as Facebook Game Platform. 

### Related Workshops and Activities
- ShellHack Unity Workshop :        Saturday 1:30 - 2:30am at Brickell. See ya there ;)
- Gaming Tournament:                Sunday   1:30 - 3:00 am at Brickell. 
- Meet Amazon :                     Saturday 9:15 - 10am at Crandon Beach 
- Microsoft Workshop :              Saturday 2:00 - 2:45pm at Crandon Beach. 

### Mentors on site
Please do remember that while we want to help everyone have great hacks, we might not be available at all times. Please be patient and respectful for their time, running a hackathon is a lot of work!!

### Online Resources
**Unity** 
- [C# For Beginers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_basic_syntax.htm): If you have experience with Java then this will be a breeze. You can translate the majority of Java syntax with a few notable expceptions into C#.
- [C++ For Beginers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_overview.htm): C++ is a bit more complicated and unforgiving. While you can move in a few concepts from Java, it will not suffice. While it is a bit more tedious, those up for the challenge will be rewarded with C++ practice and knowledge which can be transfered to other hot topics like Artificial Inteligence and Machine Learning (OpenCV for C++)
- [Unity Roll a Ball](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial): This Unity tutorial will take you through the basics of using the Unity Editor and how to make simple games in minutes!! I highly recomend using this tutorial as a starting point to new peeps, and build on what you learn in the tutorial.
